                <p>Yoga practice is thousands of years old. However, it has become prevalent in the West since the last few decades. It is practiced by almost 37 million people and not all go to yoga studio to practice. One can just roll out a mat and also begin the practice at home, and that is usually the first place people begin their practice.

            <h3>What is Yoga?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Yoga is simply the union of body, mind and spirit. It is a place of connection with your own body through proper stretching techniques, balance, breathwork and meditation that calms the mind and centers the body.</p>    
            <br>
            <!-- Types of Yoga -->
            <h2>Different types of Yoga</h2>
            <br>

            <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
            <br> 
            <div class="asana-image">
            <img src="assets/images/Asana2.jpg" alt="Vinyasa asana">
            <br>
            <p>Vinyasa yoga also called as “Vinyasa Flow” is an incredibly common style that links breath and movement. It is a style of yoga where breath is synchronized with rhythmic movements. This practice can be very calming for the mind and nervous system even though you are moving.</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Who can benefit from it? Beginners and who want less stillness and more movement in their practice. Suitable for children</em></p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Hatha yoga is an ancient form of yoga, where Hatha means forceful, but in terms of concentration and rhythm of practice. It nowhere means to apply unnecessary force on the body. It is a mix of asanas (postures) and pranayam (breath work).</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Who can benefit from it? Beginners and anyone who wants to do a gentle practice. Suitable for children.</em></p>
            <br>

            <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="stretching-image">
                <img src="assets/images/stretching2.jpg" alt="yin yoga child#s pose">
                <br>
                <p>Yin yoga is a slower type of Yoga where poses are held for a minute and can go up to 5 minutes or more. This practice is designed to increase blood circulation in joints and improve flexibility.  The practice uses props like bolsters, blocks and blankets, that help one relax. It helps in recovery from a hard workout.</p>
                <br>
                <p><em>Who can benefit from it? Anyone who needs to stretch after a tough workout or needs a slower practice. Suitable for children.</em></p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <h3>Power Yoga</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="yoga-pose-image">
                <img src="assets/images/yogapose2.jpg" alt="yoga pose for power yoga">
                <br>
                <p>Power yoga is more active style of yoga and is done at quicker pace than any other forms. It helps in strengthening the muscles and also increases flexibility.</p>
               <br>
                <p><em>Who can benefit from it? Anyone who wants a good workout and less spiritual practice.</em></p>
                </div>
                <br>

            <h3>Prenatal Yoga</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Yoga is a wonderful workout for moms-to-be. Prenatal yoga can ease pains of lower back and hips common during pregnancy. It provides stress relief, and exercise, and the breathing exercises can come in handy during labor and delivery. The practice is specifically designed for moms-to-be so it excludes postures that are too taxing or unsafe during pregnancy (Be sure to check with your doctor before you begin any form of exercise).</p>
                <br>
                <p><em>Who can benefit from it?Moms-to-be or new moms getting back with their exercise regime.</em></p>
                <br>
                <h3>Aerial Yoga</h3>
                <br>
                <div class="aerial-yoga-image">
                    <img src="assets/images/inversion-with-aerial-yoga.webp" alt="aerial yoga">
                    <br>
                    <p>Relatively new form of yoga, but quickly becoming popular. It involves traditional yoga poses but with a prop that is a strong silky hammock that hangs from the ceiling. The hammock is a supportive prop that can be used to perform downward dogs, inversions (headstand and handstand) which are beyond your capabilities, but you can still reap the benefits of inversions. Inversions reverses the blood flow in the body and decompresses the spine providing great amount of relief. Classes can be challenging or relaxing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><em>Who can benefit from it?Anyone who wants to reap the benefits of inversions but are fearful of going upside down on their own.</em></p>
                 </div>
                 <br>
